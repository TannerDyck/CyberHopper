# CyberHopper

Created for the Retro Twist Game Jam, CyberHopper is a cyberified take on the classic Frogger game. The twist? We added modern visuals and exciting power-ups to the retro gameplay! Guide your cyber-frog across hazardous traffic and treacherous platforms to reach the safety of the home pads.

## Gameplay

Navigate your frog upwards, avoiding cyber-vehicles, rivers, and other dangers. Reach one of the five home pads at the top of the screen to score points. Fill all five homes to complete the level and earn a massive bonus!

## Controls

*   **Move Up**: `W` or `Up Arrow`
*   **Move Down**: `S` or `Down Arrow`
*   **Move Left**: `A` or `Left Arrow`
*   **Move Right**: `D` or `Right Arrow`

## Scoring

*   **Advance Row**: +10 points for each forward jump reaching a new farthest row.
*   **Reach Home**: +50 points for successfully guiding a frog to an empty home pad.
*   **Time Bonus**: +20 points multiplied by the seconds remaining on the timer when a frog reaches home.
*   **Level Clear Bonus**: +1000 points for filling all five home pads.

## Power-ups

Collect these special items to gain an advantage:

*   **Invincibility Shield**: Grants temporary immunity from all obstacles. Your frog will flash blue while this is active.
*   **Speed Boost**: Increases your frog's movement speed, allowing for quicker leaps. Your frog will flash a yellow while this is active.

## Lives & Timer

*   You start with 3 lives.
*   Each attempt to cross is timed (default: 30 seconds).
*   Running out of time or getting hit by an obstacle (without invincibility) costs a life.
*   The game ends when you run out of lives.
